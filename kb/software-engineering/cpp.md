## The C++ Language

C++ has language facilities similar to the C language such as being a procedural programming language but is vastly different in many ways.

### Building C++ Programs

C++ must be compiled from source files into object files and then linked into an executable file.

C++ is a statically typed language in that every entity (i.e. object, name, value, etc.) must be known to the compiler at compile-time.
