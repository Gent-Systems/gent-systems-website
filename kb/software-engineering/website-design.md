# Website Design

A good starting point might be to check out the tutorials and reference over at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)

* [Google Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/)

## Page Layout

* [jQuery-menu-aim](https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim): jQuery plugin for dropdown menus that can differentiate between a user trying to hover over a dropdown item vs trying to navigate into a submenu's contents.

### Icons

* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/): Large selection of vector graphic icons as well as brand icons
* [Google Material Icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/): Google icons for standard icons and large CDN distribution

## Content

### Markdown

* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* To embed LaTeX or other [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) capable equations and symbols, use `$` symbols like `$ \some \math \commands $` to put rendered equations inline
    - Use double `$$` symbols to have a formula appear on it's own new line
    - For kramdown, double dollarsigns actually represent math that will go inline with text. To have math statements appear on a newline (i.e. not inline), use escaped dollar signs such as `\$\$ 5 + 5 $$`
    - It's also useful to use online LaTeX editors like [CodeCogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php)
* [kramdown Syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html): kramdown is used in [Jekyll](#Jekyll)
* [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
