# Website Design

A good starting point might be to check out the tutorials and reference over at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Page Layout

* [jQuery-menu-aim](https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim): jQuery plugin for dropdown menus that can differentiate between a user trying to hover over a dropdown item vs trying to navigate into a submenu's contents.

### Icons

* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/): Large selection of vector graphic icons as well as brand icons
* [Google Material Icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/): Google icons for standard icons and large CDN distribution

## Content

### Markdown

* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* To embed LaTeX or other [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) capable equations and symbols, use `$` symbols like `$ \some \math \commands $` to put rendered equations inline
    - Use double `$$` symbols to have a formula appear on it's own new line
    - It's also useful to use online LaTeX editors like [CodeCogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php)

## Google Tools

* [Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/): Easy website tracking and analytics that can be added to any website (including this one).
* [PageSpeed Tools](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/): Analyze websites and pages and recommends actions to make pages faster and more optimized.
