## Overview

VHDL is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model and describe digital systems and their behavior. Like computer programming languages, to successfully design complex digital components or systems in VHDL, one should take advantage of abstraction and hierarchical methods. For digital systems, we can typically break a design down into three main domain models:
+ _Functional:_ Describes the operation and implementation of a design
    * E.x. Boolean equations, register-transfer language, algorithm, etc.
+ _Structural:_ Describes the interconnection of subsystems and components
    * E.x. Transistor, gate, ALU, etc.
