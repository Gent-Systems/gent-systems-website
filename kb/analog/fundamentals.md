# Analog Engineering Fundamentals

## Direct Current Circuit Analysis (DC)

## Alternating Current Circuit Analysis (AC)

Electromagnetic (EM) waves behave like all other waves:
* They can be continuous or happen in short bursts
* They propagate in some medium over time and attenuate as they propagate
* They can be absorbed or reflected
* Their paths can be guided
