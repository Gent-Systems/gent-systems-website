# High-Performance Electrical Design

## Overview

The goal: to build devices that go faster, are more precise and further push the boundaries of what's been done before. High-speed designs are those where we care about very fast rise and fall times (edge rates) and track lengths due to reduced setup and hold times. In general, if $$ t_{rise}< \frac{1}{10*f_{clock}} $$ then the design is considered high-speed. With these higher speeds, we need to focus on signal integrity on interface lines as issues like reflections, coupled signals and greater electromagnetic radiation.
